Problem:  Movie Scheduling Problem
Input:  A set I of n intervals on the line.
Output:  What is the largest subset of mutually non-overlapping intervals which can be selected from I?

Known:  All movies incur same price, we want max money.

create movies with a start and end time.  start occurs before end
def genMovieTimeline(I, n):
	for i in range(0, n):
		start = int(Random.uniform(0,1) * 100);
		end = Random.randint(start, 100);
		I.append([start, end]);

compute the total time movie will take, append it to I
def computeMovieLength(I):
	for x in I:
		x.append(x[1]-x[0]);
